# Stack
- next js using app router
- shadcn for ui
- prisma for a db using mysql
- react-hook-form for form handling
- zustand for form validation

# General Guide
- when writing pages always prefer sever side fetching to client hooks
- always write server code in src/app/api as routes
- keep the router code clean, with the routes themselves calling another function like in [route.ts](mdc:src/app/api/eras/route.ts)
- use the functions called by the router code for actions as well in src/actions so that client components can reuse the logic

# Guide for styling
- always use shadcn components wherever possible. Use shadcn not shadcn-ui
- we are using tailwind v4
- the site should be elegant but not ornate. simple but clean and beautiful is best.

# Guide for running
- there is always a dev server being run with pnpm dev
- use pnpm for all node related commands
